The car, which is the successor to the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren and was described by Mercedes-Benz as a spiritual successor to the Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing, mainly because it was inspired by the latter. SLS stands for "Super Leicht Sport" (Super Light Sport).
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The SLS was the first Mercedes-Benz automobile designed and built from scratch entirely by AMG. Upon its introduction at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, the SLS AMG's 571 PS (420 kW; 563 hp) M159 engine was according to AMG "the world's most powerful naturally aspirated production series engine" ever produced.</span></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">An electric version of the car, the SLS AMG Electric Drive, was presented at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. Production ended in 2014 with the introduction of the SLS AMG GT Final Edition.[8]&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">As compared to its predecessor (the Mercedes-McLaren SLR), the SLS is per Mercedes-AMG head Tobias Moers, the faster car on the track, both in the hands of normal drivers as well as race car drivers. The Mercedes-McLaren SLR came in at 1,750 kg (3,858 lb).[10] The SLS, however, has a curb weight of 1,619 kg (3,569 lb) when equipped with the standard wheels.</span></p></div>

<br>Interior
<br>The SLS AMG was designed by Mark Fetherston to be a modern 300SL Gullwing revival from October 2006 to April 2007.[11][12] The SLS AMG has also adapted the feature of the gull-wing doors that swing open upwards on gas struts, and must be closed manually as AMG engineers decided against the 41 kg (90 lb) of additional weight that auto-closing systems would have added to the car.[13] In case of a roll-over, the doors can be fully detached to allow the occupants to leave the vehicle.</p>

<br>The SLS AMG has won a number of design awards, including the 2010 red dot "best of the best" award, the iF product design award 2010 for the "Transportation Design" category, and the Auto Bild Design Award 2010 as "Europe's most attractive car". It is also the only automobile to have won the gold Design Award of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>

<br>In the June 2010 issue of Car and Driver magazine, safety specifications were revealed pertaining to the safety of the SLS AMG's gullwing doors. Ten to fifteen milliseconds after a detected rollover, explosive bolts situated at the top of the door frame fire and bell cranks separate the doors from the car for easy exit during a serious accident. An anti-lock braking system and a 3-stage electronic stability program (ESP) are standard equipment.

<br>The retractable rear wing of the SLS AMG acts as an airbrake when braking
<br>The exterior aluminum body is supplied by Magna Steyr. The SLS and the CL65 AMG 40th Anniversary Edition are the only roadgoing Mercedes-Benz automobiles with the AMG Alubeam Silver exterior paint available, at an extra cost of €11,900 in Germany. Other colours include both metallic and matte colours, such as Designo Magno Kashmir, the matte paint known from the SL63 AMG IWC edition.
<br>
<br>The SLS AMG has a retractable rear wing which extends at a speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) for stability and handling and acts as an airbrake when braking.</p>

</p><p>The first model introduced in the SLS lineage was the coupé with gullwing doors. In mid-2010, an FIA-GT3 racing version was introduced; and for 2011–2013, Mercedes introduced a roadster version (with conventional doors and a soft top), an electric E-Cell version (coupé), and the ultimate iteration named the Black Series, which has a reduced weight of 70 kg (154 lb).

<br>Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Black Series in Solarbeam Yellow
<br>Unveiled at the 2012 LA Auto Show,[75][76] with a market launch that began in June 2013.[77] the SLS AMG Black Series is a high-performance variant of the SLS AMG Coupé inspired by the SLS AMG GT3. Notable changes over the SLS AMG include increased engine power to 631 PS (464 kW; 622 hp) at 7,400 rpm and decreased torque to 635 N⋅m (468 lb⋅ft) at 5,500 rpm along with increased engine redline of 8,000 rpm, fully revised high-speed valvetrain with modified camshafts, adapted cam geometry and optimised bucket tappets having a special coating which is otherwise exclusive to racing cars, modification of the intake air ducts (derestriction and adaptation to the new maximum engine speed), adaptation of the engine application and increase in peak pressure. This results in an acceleration time from 0-97 km/h (60 mph) in 3.2 seconds (Car and Driver test)[78] (2/10 of a second faster than the SLS AMG GT),[79] and a top speed of 196 mph (315 km/h)[78]

This is accomplished by increased use of carbon fibre in body panels, mechanical components, and the space frame. Further, a switch from steel to titanium for the exhaust system reduces weight by 13 kg (29 lb). The use of lithium-ion battery reduces weight by 8 kg (18 lb).

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The AMG SpeedShift DCT 7-speed sports transmission is installed 10 mm (0.39 in) lower in order to achieve a lower centre of gravity for the car and is braced against the body by gas-filled struts in order to avoid stress cycles. The transmission's "Sport plus" and "Manual" modes have faster shifting speed than the standard model. The downshifting throttle blips are more audible. The new temporary "M" mode enables the driver to activate manual mode without having to remove a hand from the steering wheel, by pressing the "up" or "down" shift paddle once.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>

</strong></p><p><strong>Following the introduction of the SLS AMG E-CELL prototype, the production of SLS AMG E-CELL was originally announced at the 2011 North American International Auto Show. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Powertrain&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The SLS AMG Electric Drive was powered by four electric motors with combined ratings of 552 kW (751 PS; 740 hp) and 1,000 N⋅m (738 lb⋅ft). Each motor can spin up to 13,000 rpm and weighs 45 kg (99 lb). In addition, the transmission allows each motor to selectively drive all 4 wheels. This enables the car to accelerate from a stand still to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.9 seconds. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Battery&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The SLS AMG Electric Drive included a liquid-cooled 400 V lithium-ion battery rated to 60 kWh that had a range of 250 km (160 mi) under the combined New European Driving Cycle. The 548 kg (1,208 lb) battery pack is made up of 12 modules, each comprising 72 lithium-ion cells. The system was designed as a collaboration between Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains Ltd.</strong></p></div>
